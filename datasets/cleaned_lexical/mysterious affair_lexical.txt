young man depart close door poirot eye met mine
yes say nod gravely
evidence give inquest
go slowly upstairs
opening lip poirot stop gesture hand
mon ami
need reflection
mind disorder well
ten minute sat dead silence perfectly still except several expressive motion eyebrow time eye grow steadily greener
last heave deep sigh
well
bad moment pass
arrange classify
one must never permit confusion
case clear yet
complicate
puzzle
hercule poirot
two fact significance
first state weather yesterday
important
glorious day
interrupt
poirot pull leg
thermometer register 80 degree shade
forget friend
key whole riddle
second point
ask
important fact monsieur inglethorp wear peculiar clothes black beard us glass
poirot cannot believe serious
absolutely serious friend
childish
momentous
suppose coroner jury return verdict wilful murder alfred inglethorp
becomes theory
would shaken twelve stupid men happen make mistake
occur
one thing country jury anxious take responsibility upon mr inglethorp stand practically position local squire
also add placidly allow
would allow
look extraordinary little man divide annoyance amusement
tremendously sure
though read thought nod gently
oh yes mon ami would say
get laid hand shoulder
physiognomy underwent complete change
tear come eye
see think poor mr inglethorp dead
extravagantly love
good u belgian owe debt
endeavour interrupt poirot swept
let tell hastings
would never forgive let alfred inglethorp husband arrest word could save
interval inquest poirot unfailing activity
twice closet mr well
also take long walk country
rather resent take confidence could least guess drive
occur might make inquiry raikes farm find call leastways cottage wednesday even walk field hop meet
sign hesitate go right farm
walk away met age rustic leer cunningly
hall bain
ask
yes
look friend mine thought might walk way
little chap
wave hand talk
one belgies village
yes say eagerly
oh ay right enough
n
friend
ah gentleman hall pretty lot
leer jocosely ever
gentleman hall come often
ask carelessly could
wink knowingly
one mister
name name mind
liberal gentleman
oh thank sir sure
walk sharply
evelyn howard right experienced sharp twinge disgust thought alfred inglethorp liberality another woman money
piquant gipsy face bottom crime baser mainspring money
probably judicious mixture
one point poirot seem curious obsession
twice observe thought dorcas must make error fix time quarrel
suggest repeatedly four thirty four clock heard voice
dorcas unshaken
quite hour even elapse time heard voice five clock take tea mistress
inquest held friday stylite arm village
poirot sat together require give evidence
preliminary go
jury view body john cavendish give evidence identification
question described awaken early hour morning circumstance mother death
medical evidence next take
breathless hush every eye fix famous london specialist know one great authority day subject toxicology
brief word sum result post mortem
shorn medical phraseology technicality amount fact mr inglethorp met death result strychnine poison
judging quantity recover must take less three quarter grain strychnine probably one grain slightly
possible could swallow poison accident
ask coroner
consider unlikely
strychnine use domestic purpose poison restriction place sale
anything examination lead determine poison administer
arrive style dr wilkins believe
motor met outside lodge gate hurry fast could
relate u exactly happen next
enter mr inglethorp room
moment typical tetanic convulsion
turn towards gasped alfred alfred could strychnine administer mr inglethorp dinner coffee take husband
possibly strychnine fairly rapid drug action
symptom appear one two hour swallow
retard certain condition none however appear present case
presume mr inglethorp take coffee dinner eight clock whereas symptom manifest early hour morning face point drug take much later even
mr inglethorp habit drinking cup cocoa middle night
could strychnine administer
take sample cocoa remain saucepan analyse
strychnine present
heard poirot chuckle softly beside
know
whisper
listen
say doctor continue would considerably surprised result
simply strychnine unusually bitter taste
detect solution one seventy thousand disguise strongly flavour substance
cocoa would quite powerless mask
one jury want know objection apply coffee
coffee bitter taste would probably cover taste strychnine
consider likely drug administer coffee unknown reason action delayed
yes cup completely smash possibility analyze content
conclude dr bauerstein evidence
dr wilkins corroborate point
sound possibility suicide repudiate utterly
decease say suffer weak heart otherwise enjoy perfect health cheerful well balance disposition
would one last people take life
lawrence cavendish next call
evidence quite unimportant mere repetition brother
step pause say rather hesitatingly like make suggestion may
glance deprecatingly coroner reply briskly certainly mr cavendish arrive truth matter welcome anything may lead elucidation
idea mine explain lawrence
course may quite wrong still seem mother death might account natural mean
make mr
cavendish
mother time death time take tonic contain strychnine
ah
say coroner
jury look interested
believe continued lawrence case cumulative effect drug administer time end cause death
also possible may take overdose medicine accident
first heard decease take strychnine time death
much oblige mr
cavendish
dr wilkins recall ridicule idea
mr cavendish suggests quite impossible
doctor would tell
strychnine certain sense cumulative poison would quite impossible result sudden death way
would long period chronic symptom would attract attention
whole thing absurd
second suggestion
mr inglethorp may inadvertently take overdose
three even four dos would result death
mr inglethorp always extra large amount medicine make time dealt coot cash chemist tadminster
would take nearly whole bottle account amount strychnine found post mortem
consider may dismiss tonic way instrumental cause death
certainly
supposition ridiculous
juryman interrupt suggest chemist make medicine might commit error
course always possible reply doctor
dorcas next witness call dispel even possibility
medicine newly make
contrary mr inglethorp take last dose day death
question tonic finally abandon coroner proceed task
elicit dorcas awaken violent ring mistress bell subsequently rouse household pass subject quarrel precede afternoon
dorcas evidence point substantially poirot already heard repeat
next witness mary cavendish
stood upright spoke low clear perfectly compose voice

mr inglethorp say coroner heard wife die word repeat

read wife last word accusation inglethorp continue contrary appeal
coroner reflect moment say believe mr inglethorp pour coffee take wife even
pour yes
take
meant told friend hall door laid coffee hall table
come hall minute later go
statement might might true seem improve matter much inglethorp
case ample time introduce poison
point poirot nudge gently indicate two men sit together near door
one little sharp dark ferret face man tall fair
question poirot mutely
put lip ear
know little man
shook head
detective inspector james japp scotland yard jimmy japp
man scotland yard
thing move quickly friend
star two men intently
certainly nothing policeman
never suspect official personage
still star startle recall verdict give wilful murder person person unknown
come stylite arm poirot drew aside gentle pressure arm
understood object
wait scotland yard men
moment emerge poirot step forward accost shorter two
fear remember inspector japp
mr
poirot
cry inspector
turn man
heard speak mr poirot
1904 work together abercrombie forgery case remember run brussels
ah great day moosier
remember baron altara
pretty rogue
elude clutch half police europe
nail antwerp thanks mr poirot
friendly reminiscence indulge drew nearer introduce detective inspector japp turn introduce u companion superintendent summerhaye
need hardly ask gentleman remark poirot
japp close one eye knowingly
indeed
pretty clear case say
poirot answer gravely differ
oh come
say summerhaye opening lip first time
surely whole thing clear daylight
man caught red hand
could fool beat
japp look attentively poirot
hold fire summerhaye remark jocularly
moosier met man judgment sooner take
greatly mistaken get something sleeve
moosier
poirot smile
drawn certain conclusion yes
summerhaye still look rather sceptical japp continued scrutiny poirot
way say far see case outside
yard disadvantage case kind murder speak inquest
lot depends spot first thing mr poirot start u
soon even fact smart doctor spot give u tip coroner
spot first may picked little hint
evidence inquest mr inglethorp murder wife sure stand anyone hint contrary laugh face
must say surprised jury bring wilful murder right
think would coroner seem hold back
perhaps though warrant arrest pocket suggest poirot
kind wooden shutter officialdom come japp expressive countenance
perhaps perhaps remark dryly
poirot look thoughtfully
anxious monsieur arrest
dare say observe summerhaye sarcastically
japp regard poirot comical perplexity
go little mr poirot
wink good nod
spot yard want make mistake know
poirot nod gravely
exactly thought
well tell
use warrant arrest mr inglethorp
bring kudos case dismiss
comme ca
snap finger expressively
japp face grow grave though summerhaye give incredulous snort
literally dumb astonishment
could conclude poirot mad
japp take handkerchief gently dab brow
daren mr poirot
take word others ask devil mean
give little go
poirot reflect moment
do say last
admit wish
force hand
would prefer work dark present say word belgian policeman whose day past enough
alfred inglethorp must arrest
sworn friend hastings know
see good japp go style
well half hour
see coroner doctor first
good
call passing last house village
go
style mr inglethorp give refuse probable give proof shall satisfy case could possibly sustain
bargain
bargain say japp heartily
behalf yard much oblige though bound confess present see faintest possible loop hole evidence always marvel
long moosier
two detective strode away summerhaye incredulous grin face
well friend cry poirot could get word think
mon dieu
warm moment court figure man would pig head refuse say anything
decidedly policy imbecile
h
explanation besides imbecility remark
case true could defend except silence
thousand ingenious way cry poirot
see say commit murder think seven plausible story
far convincing mr inglethorp stony denial
could help laugh
dear poirot sure capable think seventy
seriously spite heard say detective surely cannot still believe possibility alfred inglethorp innocence
much
nothing change
evidence conclusive
yes conclusive
turn gate leastways cottage proceed familiar stair
yes yes conclusive continued poirot almost
real evidence usually vague unsatisfactory
examine sift
whole thing cut dry
friend evidence cleverly manufacture cleverly defeat end
make
long evidence vague intangible hard disprove
anxiety criminal drawn net closely one cut set inglethorp free
silent
minute two poirot continued let u look matter like
man let u say set poison wife
live wit say go
presumably therefore wit
altogether fool
well set
go boldly village chemist purchase strychnine name trumped story dog bound prove absurd
employ poison night
wait violent quarrel whole household cognisant naturally directs suspicion upon
prepares defence shadow alibi yet know chemist assistant must necessarily come forward fact
bah
ask believe man could idiotic
lunatic wish commit suicide cause hang would act
still see begin
neither see
tell mon ami puzzle
hercule poirot
believe innocent explain buying strychnine
simply
buy
mace recognize
beg pardon saw man black beard like mr inglethorp wear glass like mr inglethorp dress mr inglethorp rather noticeable clothes
could recognize man probably see distance since remember village fortnight mr inglethorp dealt principally coot tadminster
think mon ami remember two point laid stress upon
leave first one moment second
important fact alfred inglethorp wear peculiar clothes black beard us glass quote
exactly
suppose anyone wish pas john lawrence cavendish
would easy
say thoughtfully
course actor poirot cut short ruthlessly
would easy
tell friend clean shaven men
make successfully one two broad daylight would need actor genius certain initial facial resemblance
case alfred inglethorp change
clothes beard glass hide eye salient point personal appearance
first instinct criminal
divert suspicion
best
throw someone else
instance man ready hand
everybody predispose believe mr inglethorp guilt
foregone conclusion would suspect make sure thing must tangible proof actual buying poison man peculiar appearance mr inglethorp difficult
remember young mace never actually spoken mr inglethorp
doubt man clothes beard glass alfred inglethorp
may say fascinate poirot eloquence
case say six clock monday even
ah indeed
say poirot calm
arrest probably would speak want come
must make see gravity position
course something discreditable behind silence
murder wife nevertheless scoundrel something conceal quite apart murder
muse poirot view moment although still retain faint conviction obvious deduction correct one
guess
ask poirot smile
oh yes little idea sometime ago turn correct
never told say reproachfully
poirot spread hand apologetically
pardon mon ami precisely sympathique
turn earnestly
tell see must arrest
perhaps say doubtfully really quite indifferent fate alfred inglethorp thought good fright would harm
poirot watch intently give sigh
come friend say change subject apart mr inglethorp evidence inquest strike
oh pretty much expect
nothing strike peculiar
thought flew mary cavendish hedge way
well mr lawrence cavendish evidence instance
relieve
oh lawrence
think
always nervous chap
suggestion mother might poison accidentally mean tonic take strike strange hein
say
doctor ridicule course
quite natural suggestion layman make
monsieur lawrence layman
told start study medicine take degree
yes true
never thought
rather startle
odd
poirot nod
first behaviour peculiar
household alone would likely recognize symptom strychnine poison yet find member family uphold strenuously theory death natural cause
monsieur john could understood
technical knowledge nature unimaginative
monsieur lawrence
day put forward suggestion must know ridiculous
food thought mon ami
confuse agree
mr cavendish continued poirot
another tell know
make attitude
know make
seem inconceivable shield alfred inglethorp
yet look like
poirot nod reflectively
yes queer
one thing certain overheard good deal private conversation willing admit
yet last person one would accuse stoop eavesdrop
exactly
one thing evidence show
make mistake
dorcas quite right
quarrel take place earlier afternoon four clock say
look curiously
never understood insistence point
yes good deal peculiar come day continued poirot
dr bauerstein dress hour morning
astonish one comment fact
insomnia believe say doubtfully
good bad explanation remark poirot
cover everything explains nothing
shall keep eye clever dr
bauerstein
fault find evidence
inquire satirically
mon ami reply poirot gravely find people tell truth look
unless much mistaken inquest day one two person speak truth without reservation subterfuge
oh come poirot
cite lawrence mr cavendish
john miss howard surely speak truth
friend
one grant
word give unpleasant shock
miss howard evidence unimportant give downright straightforward manner never occur doubt sincerity
still great respect poirot sagacity except occasion described foolishly pig head
really think
ask
miss howard always seem essentially honest almost uncomfortably
poirot give curious look could quite fathom
seem speak checked
miss murdoch continued nothing untruthful
strange never heard sound sleep next door whereas mr cavendish wing building distinctly heard table fall
well young
sleep soundly
ah yes indeed
must famous sleeper one
quite like tone voice moment smart knock reach ear look window perceive two detective wait u
poirot seize hat give ferocious twist moustache carefully brushing imaginary speck dust sleeve motion precede stair join detective set style
think appearance two scotland yard men rather shock especially john though course verdict realize matter time
still presence detective brought truth home anything else could do
poirot confer japp low tone way latter functionary request household exception servant assemble together draw room
realize significance
poirot make boast good
personally sanguine
poirot might excellent reason belief inglethorp innocence man type summerhaye would require tangible proof doubt poirot could supply
long trooped draw room door japp close
poirot politely set chair everyone
scotland yard men cynosure eye

perfectly correct assumption vehemence alfred inglethorp violent natural quite wrong deduction draw
drawn deduction believe correct speak present
pause minute go

possible way could mr inglethorp death benefit miss howard
murder without motive
reflect

poirot shook head

little evidence
hand write expert call upon opinion signature alfred inglethorp chemist poison register
declare unanimously certainly hand write give view might prisoner disguise
cross examine admit might prisoner hand write cleverly counterfeit
sir ernest heavywether speech opening case defence long one back full force emphatic manner
never say course long experience know charge murder rest slighter evidence
entirely circumstantial great part practically unproved
let take testimony heard sift impartially
strychnine found drawer prisoner room
drawer unlocked one point submit evidence prove prisoner conceal poison
fact wicked malicious attempt part third person fix crime prisoner
prosecution unable produce shred evidence support contention prisoner order black beard parkson
quarrel take place prisoner stepmother freely admit financial embarrassment grossly exaggerated
learn friend sir ernest nod carelessly mr philip state prisoner innocent man would come forward inquest explain mr inglethorp participator quarrel
thought fact misrepresent
actually occur
prisoner return house tuesday even authoritatively told violent quarrel mr mr inglethorp
suspicion enter prisoner head anyone could possibly mistaken voice mr inglethorp
naturally conclude stepmother two quarrel
prosecution aver monday july 16th prisoner enter chemist shop village disguise mr inglethorp
prisoner contrary time lonely spot call marston spinney summon anonymous note couched blackmailing term threaten reveal certain matter wife unless comply demand
prisoner accordingly go appoint spot wait vainly half hour return home
unfortunately met one way back could vouch truth story luckily kept note would produce evidence
statement relate destruction prisoner formerly practise bar perfectly well aware make favour year automatically revoke stepmother remarriage
would call evidence show destroy possible might open quite new view case
finally would point jury evidence people besides john cavendish
would direct attention fact evidence mr lawrence cavendish quite strong strong brother

take fragment green material first found caught bolt communicate door room adjoin one occupy mademoiselle cynthia
hand fragment police consider much importance
recognize piece torn green land armlet
little stir excitement
one person style work land mr cavendish
therefore must mr cavendish enter decease room door communicate mademoiselle cynthia room

examine room yes
first place word since try particular door report fasten
ensue confusion would ample opportunity shoot bolt across
take early opportunity verify conjecture

cry lawrence
mary destroyed
shook head poirot shook also
say quietly
one person could possibly destroyed mr inglethorp
impossible
exclaim
make afternoon
nevertheless mon ami mr inglethorp
way account fact one hottest day year mr inglethorp order fire light room
give gasp
idiot never think fire incongruous
poirot continue temperature day monsieur 80 degree shade
yet mr inglethorp order fire
wish destroy something could think way
remember consequence war economics practice style waste paper thrown away
therefore mean destroy thick document
moment heard fire light mr inglethorp room leap conclusion destroy important document possibly
discovery char fragment grate surprise
course know time question make afternoon admit learnt fact fell grievous error
come conclusion mr inglethorp determination destroy arose direct consequence quarrel afternoon therefore quarrel take place make
know wrong force abandon idea
face problem new standpoint
four clock dorcas overheard mistress say angrily need think fear publicity scandal husband wife deter
conjecture conjecture rightly word address husband mr john cavendish
five clock hour later us almost word standpoint different
admits dorcas know scandal husband wife dreadful thing
four clock angry completely mistress
five clock violent distress speaks great shock
look matter psychologically drew one deduction convince correct
second scandal spoke first concerned
let u reconstruct
four clock mr inglethorp quarrel son threatens denounce wife way overheard great part conversation
four thirty mr inglethorp consequence conversation validity will make favour husband two gardener witness
five clock dorcas find mistress state considerable agitation slip paper letter dorcas think hand order fire room light
presumably four thirty five clock something occur occasion complete revolution feel since anxious destroy make
something
far know quite alone half hour
nobody enter left boudoir
occasion sudden change sentiment
one guess believe guess correct
mr inglethorp stamp desk
know later ask dorcas bring
opposite corner room stood husband desk lock
anxious find stamp accord theory try key desk
one fit know
therefore open desk search stamp come across something else slip paper dorcas saw hand assuredly never meant mr inglethorp eye
hand mr cavendish believe slip paper mother law clung tenaciously write proof husband infidelity
demand mr inglethorp assure quite truly nothing matter
mr cavendish believe
thought mr inglethorp shield stepson
mr cavendish resolute woman behind mask reserve madly jealous husband
determine get hold paper cost resolution chance come aid
happen pick key mr inglethorp despatch case lose morning
knew mother law invariably kept important paper particular case
mr cavendish therefore make plan woman driven desperate jealousy could do
time even unbolted door lead mademoiselle cynthia room
possibly apply oil hinge found open quite noiselessly try
put project early hour morning safer since servant accustom hearing move room time
dress completely land kit make way quietly mademoiselle cynthia room mr
inglethorp
pause moment cynthia interrupt woken anyone come room
drug mademoiselle
drug
mais oui
remember address u collectively tumult noise next door mademoiselle cynthia slept
admit two possibility
either sleep feign believe unconsciousness indeed artificial mean
latter idea mind examine coffee cup carefully remember mr cavendish brought mademoiselle cynthia coffee night
take sample cup analyse result
count cup carefully event one remove
six person take coffee six cup duly found
confess mistaken
discover guilty grave oversight
coffee brought seven person six dr bauerstein even
change face whole affair one cup miss
servant notice nothing since annie housemaid take coffee brought seven cup know mr inglethorp never drank whereas dorcas clear away follow morning found six usual strictly speak found five sixth one found broken mr inglethorp room
confident miss cup mademoiselle cynthia
additional reason belief fact cup found contain sugar mademoiselle cynthia never take coffee
attention attract story annie salt tray cocoa take every night mr inglethorp room
accordingly secure sample cocoa sent analyse
already do dr bauerstein say lawrence quickly
exactly
analyst ask report whether strychnine present
test narcotic
narcotic
yes
analyst report
mr cavendish administer safe effectual narcotic mr inglethorp mademoiselle cynthia
possible mauvais quart heure consequence
imagine feeling mother law suddenly take ill dy immediately hears word poison
believe sleep draught administer perfectly harmless doubt one terrible moment must fear mr inglethorp death lay door
seize panic influence hurry downstairs quickly drop coffee cup saucer use mademoiselle cynthia large brass vase discover later monsieur lawrence
remains cocoa dare touch
many eye upon
guess relief strychnine mention discovers tragedy
able account symptom strychnine poison long make appearance
narcotic take strychnine delay action poison hour
poirot pause
mary look colour slowly rise face
say quite true monsieur poirot
awful hour life
shall never forget
wonderful
understand meant told could safely confess papa poirot eh
would trust
see everything say lawrence
drug cocoa take top poison coffee amply account delay
exactly
coffee poison
come little difficulty since mr inglethorp never drank
cry surprise universal
remember speak stain carpet mr inglethorp room
peculiar point stain
still damp exhale strong odour coffee imbed nap carpet found little splinter china
happen plain two minute place little case table near window table tilt deposit upon floor precisely identical spot
exactly way mr inglethorp laid cup coffee reach room night treacherous table played trick
happen next mere guess work part say mr inglethorp picked broken cup place table bed
feel need stimulant kind heat cocoa drank
face new problem
know cocoa contain strychnine
coffee never drunk
yet strychnine must administer seven nine clock even
third medium medium suitable disguise taste strychnine extraordinary one thought
poirot look round room answer impressively
medicine
mean murderer introduce strychnine tonic
cry
need introduce
already mixture
strychnine kill mr inglethorp identical strychnine prescribed dr wilkins
make clear read extract book dispense found dispensary red cross hospital tadminster follow prescription become famous text book strychninae sulph

lady england lose life take similar mixture precipitate strychnine collect bottom take last dose swallow nearly
course bromide dr wilkins prescription remember mention empty box bromide powder
one two powder introduce full bottle medicine would effectually precipitate strychnine book describes cause take last dose
learn later person usually pour mr inglethorp medicine always extremely careful shake bottle leave sediment bottom undisturbed
throughout case evidence tragedy intend take place monday even
day mr inglethorp bell wire neatly cut monday even mademoiselle cynthia spending night friend mr inglethorp would quite alone right wing completely shut help kind would die probability medical aid could summon
hurry time village entertainment mr inglethorp forgot take medicine next day lunch away home last fatal dose actually take twenty four hour later anticipate murderer owe delay final proof last link chain hand
amid breathless excitement held three thin strip paper
letter murderer hand write me amis
little clearer term possible mr inglethorp warn time would escape
realize danger manner
deathly silence poirot piece together slip paper clearing throat read dearest evelyn anxious hearing nothing
right night instead last night
understand
good time come old woman dead way
one possibly bring home crime
idea bromide stroke genius
must circumspect
false step friend letter break

chair overturn
poirot skip nimbly aside
quick movement part assailant fell crash
monsieur madame say poirot flourish let introduce murderer mr alfred inglethorp
poirot old villain say half mind strangle
mean deceive do
sit library
several hectic day lay behind u
room john mary together alfred inglethorp miss howard custody
last poirot could relieve still burning curiosity
poirot answer moment last say deceive mon ami
permit deceive
yes
well difficult explain
see friend nature honest countenance transparent enfin conceal feeling impossible
told idea first time saw mr alfred inglethorp astute gentleman would expressive idiom smelt rat
bonjour chance catch
think diplomacy give credit
friend besought poirot implore enrage
help invaluable
extremely beautiful nature make pause
well grumble little mollify
still think might give hint
friend
several hint
would take
think ever say believe john cavendish guilty
contrary tell would almost certainly acquit
yes immediately afterwards speak difficulty bring murderer justice
plain speak two entirely different person
say plain
continued poirot begin repeat several time want mr inglethorp arrest
conveyed something
mean say suspect long ago
yes
begin whoever else might benefit mr inglethorp death husband would benefit
get away
go style first day idea crime commit knew mr inglethorp fancy would hard find anything connect
arrive chateau realize mr inglethorp burnt way cannot complain friend try best force significance bedroom fire midsummer
yes yes say impatiently
go
well friend say view mr inglethorp guilt much shaken
fact much evidence inclined believe do
change mind
found effort make clear effort make get arrest
discover inglethorp nothing mr raikes fact john cavendish interested quarter quite sure
simply
inglethorp carry intrigue mr raikes silence perfectly comprehensible
discover know village john attract farmer pretty wife silence bore quite different interpretation
nonsense pretend afraid scandal possible scandal could attach
attitude give furiously think slowly force conclusion alfred inglethorp want arrest
eh bien
moment equally determine arrest
wait minute
see wish arrest
mon ami law country man acquit never try offence
aha
clever idea
assuredly man method
see knew position bound suspect conceive exceedingly clever idea prepare lot manufacture evidence
wish arrest
would produce irreproachable alibi hey presto safe life
still see manage prove alibi yet go chemist shop
poirot star surprise
possible
poor friend
yet realize miss howard go chemist shop
miss howard
certainly
else
easy
good height voice deep manly moreover remember inglethorp cousin distinct resemblance especially gait bearing
simplicity
clever pair
still little fog exactly bromide business do remark
bon
reconstruct far possible
inclined think miss howard master mind affair
remember mention father doctor
possibly dispense medicine may take idea one many book lie mademoiselle cynthia study exam
anyway familiar fact addition bromide mixture contain strychnine would cause precipitation latter
probably idea come quite suddenly
mr inglethorp box bromide powder occasionally take night
could easy quietly dissolve one powder mr inglethorp large size bottle medicine come coot
risk practically nil
tragedy take place nearly fortnight later
anyone see either touch medicine forgotten time
miss howard engineer quarrel depart house
lapse time absence defeat suspicion
yes clever idea
left alone possible crime might never brought home
satisfied
try clever undo
poirot puffed tiny cigarette eye fix ceiling
arrange plan throw suspicion john cavendish buying strychnine village chemist signing register hand write
monday mr inglethorp take last dose medicine
monday therefore six clock alfred inglethorp arranges see number people spot far remove village
miss howard previously make cock bull story mr raikes account hold tongue afterwards
six clock miss howard disguise alfred inglethorp enters chemist shop story dog obtains strychnine writes name alfred inglethorp john handwrite previously study carefully
never john prove alibi writes anonymous note still copying hand write take remote spot exceedingly unlikely anyone see
far go well
miss howard go back middlingham
alfred inglethorp return style
nothing compromise way since miss howard strychnine want blind throw suspicion john cavendish
hitch occurs
mr inglethorp take medicine night
broken bell cynthia absence arrange inglethorp wife waste
make slip
mr inglethorp sits write accomplice fear may panic non success plan
probable mr inglethorp return earlier expect
caught act somewhat flurry hastily shuts lock desk
fear remains room may open mr inglethorp might catch sight letter could snatch
go walk wood little dream mr inglethorp open desk discover incriminate document

mr inglethorp read becomes aware perfidy husband evelyn howard though unfortunately sentence bromide conveys warn mind
know danger ignorant danger lie
decides say nothing husband sits writes solicitor ask come morrow also determines destroy immediately make
keep fatal letter
discover letter husband force lock despatch case
yes enormous risk ran see fully realize importance
letter except absolutely nothing connect crime
one thing make destroy get hold
dare take big risk keep person

figure scene
enters room unlock door mean one doorkeys much alike
hurry despatch case lock key nowhere see
terrible blow mean presence room cannot conceal hop
see clearly everything must risk sake damn piece evidence
quickly force lock penknife turn paper find look
fresh dilemma arises dare keep piece paper
may see leave room may search
paper found certain doom
probably minute hears sound mr well john leave boudoir
must act quickly
hide terrible slip paper
content waste paper basket kept case sure examine
mean destroy dare keep
look round see think mon ami
shook head
moment torn letter long thin strip roll spill thrust hurriedly amongst spill vase mantle piece
uttered exclamation
one would think look poirot continued
able leisure come back destroy solitary piece evidence
time spill vase mr inglethorp bedroom nose
cry
poirot nod
yes friend
discover last link owe fortunate discovery
yes
remember tell hand shook straighten ornament mantelpiece
yes see saw

already straighten would need straighten unless meantime someone else touch
dear murmur explanation extraordinary behaviour
rush style found still
yes race time
still understand inglethorp fool leave plenty opportunity destroy
ah opportunity
saw
yes
remember reprove take household confidence subject
yes
well friend saw one chance
sure inglethorp criminal reason would paper would hidden somewhere enlist sympathy household could effectually prevent destroy
already suspicion make matter public secure service ten amateur detective would watch unceasingly aware watchfulness would dare seek destroy document
therefore force depart house leave spill vase
surely miss howard ample opportunity aid
yes miss howard know paper existence
accordance prearrange plan never spoke alfred inglethorp
suppose deadly enemy john cavendish safely convict neither dare risk meeting
course watch kept mr inglethorp hop sooner later would lead hiding place
clever take chance
paper safe since one thought look first week likely would afterwards
lucky remark might never able bring justice
understand first begin suspect miss howard
discover told lie inquest letter receive mr

wish show letter 17th
suspicion dawn mind
remember say wise beware people tell truth
yet cry indignantly give two reason miss howard could commit crime
good reason reply poirot
long time stumble block remember significant fact alfred inglethorp cousin
could commit crime single hand reason debar accomplice
rather vehement hatred
conceal opposite emotion
undoubtedly tie passion long come style
already arrange infamous plot marry rich rather foolish old lady induce make leave money gain end cleverly conceive crime
go plan would probably left england live together poor victim money
astute unscrupulous pair
suspicion direct would make quiet preparation different denouement
arrives middlingham compromise item possession
suspicion attache
notice paid come go house
hide strychnine glass john room
put beard attic
see sooner later duly discover
quite see try fix blame john remark
would much easy bring crime home lawrence

first crush coffee cup powder foot remember go mother night determine chance test content
thenceforward strenuously quite uselessly upheld theory death natural cause
