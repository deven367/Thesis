forget one child look believe man wrong sister find track kill like dog
swear
exaggerated folly threat passionate gesture accompany mad melodramatic word make life seem vivid
familiar atmosphere
breathe freely first time many month really admire son
would like continued scene emotional scale cut short
trunk carry muffler look
lodge house drudge bustle
bargaining cabman
moment lose vulgar detail

alter already would alter
gold would wither grey

felt do wrong
dead
god
god
harry shall
know danger nothing keep straight
would do
right kill
selfish
dear dorian answer lord henry take cigarette case produce gold latten matchbox way woman ever reform man boring completely loses possible interest life
married girl would wretched
course would treat kindly
one always kind people one care nothing
would soon found absolutely indifferent
woman find husband either becomes dreadfully dowdy wear smart bonnet woman husband pay
say nothing social mistake would abject course would allow assure case whole thing would absolute failure
suppose would mutter lad walk room look horribly pale
thought duty
fault terrible tragedy prevent right
remember say fatality good resolution always make late
mine certainly
good resolution useless attempt interfere scientific law
origin pure vanity
result absolutely nil
give u luxurious sterile emotion certain charm weak
say
simply cheque men draw bank account
harry cry dorian gray come sit beside cannot feel tragedy much want
think heartless
do many foolish thing last fortnight entitle give name dorian answer lord henry sweet melancholy smile
lad frown
like explanation harry rejoin glad think heartless
nothing kind
know
yet must admit thing happen affect
seem simply like wonderful end wonderful play
terrible beauty greek tragedy tragedy take great part wound
interest question say lord henry found exquisite pleasure play lad unconscious egotism extremely interest question
fancy true explanation often happens real tragedy life occur inartistic manner hurt u crude violence absolute incoherence absurd want meaning entire lack style
affect u vulgarity affect u
give u impression sheer brute force revolt
sometimes however tragedy posse artistic element beauty cross life
element beauty real whole thing simply appeal sense dramatic effect
suddenly find longer actor spectator play
rather
watch mere wonder spectacle enthralls u
present case really happen
one kill love
wish ever experience
would make love love rest life
people adore many always insist living long cease care care
become stout tedious meet go reminiscence
awful memory woman
fearful thing
utter intellectual stagnation reveals
one absorb colour life one never remember detail
detail always vulgar
must sow poppy garden sigh dorian
necessity rejoin companion
life always poppy hand
course thing linger
wore nothing violet one season form artistic mourn romance would die
ultimately however die
forget kill
think propose sacrifice whole world
always dreadful moment
fill one terror eternity
well would believe week ago lady hampshire found seat dinner next lady question insist go whole thing dig past rake future
bury romance bed asphodel
drag assure spoil life
bound state ate enormous dinner feel anxiety
lack taste show
one charm past past
woman never know curtain fall
always want sixth act soon interest play entirely propose continue
allow way every comedy would tragic end every tragedy would culminate farce
charmingly artificial sense art
fortunate
assure dorian one woman know would do sibyl vane
ordinary woman always console
go sentimental colour
never trust woman wear mauve whatever age may woman thirty five fond pink ribbon
always mean history
others find great consolation suddenly discover good quality husband
flaunt conjugal felicity one face fascinate sin
religion console
mystery charm flirtation woman told quite understand
besides nothing make one vain told one sinner
conscience make egotist u
yes really end consolation woman find modern life
indeed mention important one
harry
say lad listlessly
oh obvious consolation
take one else admirer one loses one
good society always whitewash woman
really dorian different sibyl vane must woman one meet
something quite beautiful death
glad living century wonder happen
make one believe reality thing play romance passion love
terribly cruel
forget
afraid woman appreciate cruelty downright cruelty anything else
wonderfully primitive instinct
emancipate remain slave look master
love dominate
sure splendid
never see really absolutely angry fancy delightful look
say something day yesterday seem time merely fanciful see absolutely true hold key everything
harry
say sibyl vane represent heroine romance desdemona one night ophelia die juliet come life imogen
never come life mutter lad bury face hand
never come life
played last part
must think lonely death tawdry dress room simply strange lurid fragment jacobean tragedy wonderful scene webster ford cyril tourneur
girl never really live never really die
least always dream phantom flit shakespeare play left lovelier presence reed shakespeare music sound richer full joy
moment touch actual life mar mar pass away
mourn ophelia like
put ash head cordelia strangle
cry heaven daughter brabantio die
waste tear sibyl vane
less real
silence
even darken room
noiselessly silver foot shadow crept garden
colour fade wearily thing
time dorian gray look
explain harry murmur something sigh relief
felt say somehow afraid could express

thought could exercise influence upon living organism might thought exercise influence upon dead inorganic thing
nay without thought conscious desire might thing external vibrate unison mood passion atom call atom secret love strange affinity

sent bed threw sofa library begin think thing lord henry say
really true one could never change
felt wild longing unstained purity boyhood rise white boyhood lord henry call
knew tarnished fill mind corruption give horror fancy evil influence others experienced terrible joy life cross fairest full promise brought shame
irretrievable
hope

monstrous moment pride passion prayed portrait bear burden day keep unsullied splendour eternal youth
failure due
well sin life brought sure swift penalty along
purification punishment

curiously carve mirror lord henry give many year ago stand table white limbed cupid laugh round old

one terribly love write mad letter end idolatrous word world change make ivory gold
curve lip rewrite history
phrase come back memory repeat
loathe beauty fling mirror floor crush silver splinter beneath heel
beauty ruin beauty youth prayed
two thing life might free stain
beauty mask youth mockery
youth best
green unripe time time shallow mood sickly thought
worn livery
youth spoil
well think past
nothing could alter
future think
james vane hidden nameless grave selby churchyard
alan campbell shot one night laboratory reveal secret force know
excitement basil hallward disappearance would soon pas away
already wan
perfectly safe
indeed death basil hallward weigh upon mind
living death soul troubled
basil paint portrait mar life
could forgive
portrait do everything
basil say thing unbearable yet borne patience
murder simply madness moment
alan campbell suicide act
chosen
nothing
new life
want
wait
surely begin already
spar one innocent thing rate
would never tempt innocence
would good
thought hetty merton begin wonder portrait lock room change
surely still horrible
perhaps life become pure would able expel every sign evil passion face
perhaps sign evil already go away
would go look
take lamp table crept upstairs
unbarred door smile joy flit across strangely young look face linger moment lip
yes would good hideous thing hidden away would longer terror
felt load lift already
go quietly lock door behind custom drag purple hang portrait
cry pain indignation broke
could see change save eye look cunning mouth curve wrinkle hypocrite
thing still loathsome loathsome possible scarlet dew spot hand seem brighter like blood newly spill
tremble
merely vanity make one good deed
desire new sensation lord henry hint mock laugh
passion act part sometimes make u thing finer
perhaps
red stain large
seem crept like horrible disease wrinkle finger
blood paint foot though thing dripped blood even hand held knife
confess
mean confess
give put death
laugh
felt idea monstrous
besides even confess would believe
trace murder man anywhere
everything belonging destroyed
burn stair
world would simply say mad
would shut persist story
yet duty confess suffer public shame make public atonement
god call upon men tell sin earth well heaven
nothing could would cleanse till told sin
sin
shrug shoulder
death basil hallward seem little
think hetty merton
unjust mirror mirror soul look
vanity
curiosity
hypocrisy
nothing renunciation
something
least thought
could tell
nothing
vanity spar
hypocrisy worn mask goodness
curiosity sake try denial self
recognize
murder dog life
always burden past
really confess
never
one bit evidence left
picture evidence
would destroy
kept long
give pleasure watch change grow old
late felt pleasure
kept awake night
away fill terror l eye look upon
brought melancholy across passion
mere memory mar many moment joy
like conscience
yes conscience
would destroy
look round saw knife stabbed basil hallward
clean many time till stain left upon
bright glisten
kill painter would kill painter work meant
would kill past dead would free
would kill monstrous soul life without hideous warning would peace
seize thing stabbed picture
cry heard crash

finally vainly try force door get roof drop balcony
window yield easily bolt old
enter found hang upon wall splendid portrait master last see wonder exquisite youth beauty
lie floor dead man even dress knife heart
wither wrinkle loathsome visage
till examine ring recognize
